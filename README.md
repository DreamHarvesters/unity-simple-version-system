A simple version system for unity

System support 5 different versions:
1. Major version: Manually increased. Resets all lower level versions
2. Minor version: Manually increased. Resets all lower level versions
3. Build version: Increased 1 with every build automatically
4. Revision version: Increased 1 with every assembly reload, reimport automatically
5. Play version: Increased 1 with playing the scene.

Build, revision and play versions can be switched on/off to be increased automatically in the DH/Versioning menu. These version numbers can cause conflicts in a subversion system because they' ll be stored locally on every developers end.

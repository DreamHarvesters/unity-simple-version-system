A simple version system for unity

System support 5 different versions:
# Major version: Manually increased. Resets all lower level versions
# Minor version: Manually increased. Resets all lower level versions
# Build version: Increased 1 with every build automatically
# Revision version: Increased 1 with every assembly reload, reimport automatically
# Play version: Increased 1 with playing the scene.

Build, revision and play versions can be switched on/off to be increased automatically in the DH/Versioning menu. These version numbers can cause conflicts in a subversion system because they' ll be stored locally on every developers end.
